# Motivation 

A key goal of both sports teams and sports journalists is understanding how player ability evolves over time. Forecasting player ability is essential for teams considering player acquisition, either via the draft, free agency or trades as well as strategic planning. Often, production curves are used to describe similarities in production across related players.
*As a result, analysis of production curves could provide useful insight into player archetypes, and how various archetypes change with age* .

# Production Curves in Sports 
Most commonly, in a production curve analysis,  a continuous measurement of aggregate skill (i.e. RAPM or VORP), denoted $Y_{pt}$ is considered for a particular
player at time $t$, $Y_{pt} \approx f_p(t) + \epsilon_p(t)$, where $f_p(t)$ is the average production for
player at any time $t$ and $\epsilon_p(t)$ represents the residual uncertainty about player
production, typically assumed to be uncorrelated over time.
Athletes not only exhibit different career trajectories, but their careers occur begin and end at different ages, can be
interrupted by injuries, and include different amounts of playing time. As such, the statistical challenge in production curve analysis is to infer smooth trajectories $f_p(t)$ from sparse,  irregular observations of $Y_{pt}$ across players.

# Relevant Work

1. Bayesian Hierarchical Framework
    - Hierarchical aging model to compare player abilities across different eras in three sports: hockey, golf, and baseball [@berry1999bridging]
    - Gaussian Process regressions to infer how production evolves across different basketball positions [@page2013effect]
    - Parametric curves to describe trajectories before and after peak-performance [@vaci2019large]

2. Functional Data Analysis
    - Functional principal components metrics can be used in an unsupervised fashion to 
        identify clusters of players with similar trajectories [@wakim2014functional]
    - Nearest Neighbor algorithm to characterize similarity between players [@natesilver538_2015]
    - Each player’s production curve is represented as a convex combination of curves from the same set of archetype [@vinue2015archetypoids]

# Current Contribution
In this work, we propose a model for jointly inferring how multiple of athleticism and skill co-evolve over a player’s career. Our model explicitly accounts for
multiple sources of variability in the metrics by accounting for dependence across similar player types, dependence between metrics which measure
similar aspects of latent player ability and, of course, autocorrelation in time.
Further, unlike previous approaches, we give more careful consideration to the
sampling distribution of observed metrics. 

# Data Overview
1. $\approx$ 2k NBA players from years 1997 - 2021, from the ages of 18 - 39
2. Longitudinal mixed tensor valued data $\mathcal{X}$ of size $N$ by $T$ by $K$
where $N$ is the number of players, $T$ is the number of years in a player's career, and $K$ are the number of production metric curves with $\mathcal{X}_{ntk}$ is missing if player $n$ is not observed for metric $k$ at age $t$. 
3. $\Omega$ is binary tensor of same size as $\mathcal{X}$ indicating missingness. 

# Modeling Assumptions

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of metric indices $i$ associated
with metrics reflecting the number of successes in $n$ attempts, i.e. Binomial
metrics, $\mathcal{R}$ correspond to count metrics which occur at a given rate for each
minute played, i.e. Poisson metrics, and $\mathcal{G}$ correspond to metrics which can be
characterized as approximately Gaussian. 

1. $\mathcal{R} =$ {FGA, FG3A, FTA, Blocks, OREB, DREB, TOV, AST, STL, Fouls}
2. $\mathcal{B} =$ {FGM, FG3M, FTM}
3. $\mathcal{N} =$ {FGA, FG3A, FTA}
4. $\mathcal{G} =$ {DBPM, OBPM, log(Minutes)}.  

\begin{align}
Y_{pi}(t)  &\sim
\begin{cases}
Pois(M_{pit}e^{f_{pi}(t)}) \text{ if  } i \in \mathcal{R}\\
Bin(N_{pit}, logit^{-1}(f_{pi}(t))) \text{ if } i \in \mathcal{B}\\
\mathcal{N}(f_{pi}(t), \frac{\sigma^2_i}{M_{pit}})  \text{ if } i \in \mathcal{G}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

# Modeling Assumptions (contd.)
1. Space of players live in low dimensional latent space $X \in \mathbb{R} ^{N x D}$
2. For a given time $t$, and metric $k$, $f_{tk} \sim \mathcal{GP}(0, K_x)$
    - Approximation of $f_{tk}$ is given by Random Fourier Features such that $f_{tk} \approx \phi(X)^T\beta_{tk}$ [@gundersen2020latent]
    - Inducing correlation across time $t$ and metric $k$ comes from inducing correlation amongst linear weights $\beta_{tk}$. 
    - Separable covariance structure for time, metric, and player. 

# Challenges 

1. MCMC Convergence (multi-modal posterior)
    - show example posterior chains
2. Identifiability (rotational invariance of model)
3. Modeling temporal and within-metric correlation
4. Missing Not At Random (MNAR) due to selection bias

# Methods

In order to address identifiability issues and MCMC convergence, we propose an alternating scheme to estimate the latent space $X$ and functional bases $\beta_{tk}$. 

1. Initialize $X$ 
    - Exponential PPCA, Probabilistic Tensor Decomposition, Standard PCA, etc.
    - Make note of how different methods yielded "better" clustering / initialization in the latent space (i.e probabilistic methods accounted for sampling variance / outlier shrinkage, and make note of how each of these methods affected results)
2. Using $X$ from above, conduct inference on $\beta_{tk}$ using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques
3. Fixing $\beta_{tk}$ from above, conduct inference on $X$ using HMC techniques. 


# Current Results 

1. (plots of example player production curves)
2. (plots of the different types of curves)
3. Correlation matrix of latent curves of metrics
4. Dendrogram of latent space
5. Separation in latent space

# Future Direction

1. Use model to identify causal effect of types of injuries across varying types of players. 
2. Address selection bias issue.
